## 🧠 Problem Statement

Every year, millions of students graduate with strong academic projects — yet struggle to secure jobs.

The problem is not lack of skill.

The real problem is:
- Academic work does not directly translate into industry-ready skills
- Students don't know their real career readiness level
- There is no structured roadmap based on verified abilities
- Resume skills are often self-claimed and unverified

There is a massive gap between:
📚 Academics → 💼 Industry
